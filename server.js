# RUN THE BOT:
    You can run the bot locally using the Bot Framework Emulator but for the best
    experience you should register a new bot on Skype and bind it to the demo 
    bot. You can then run the bot locally using ngrok found at https://ngrok.com/.
    * Install and run ngrok in a console window using "ngrok http 3978".
    * Create a bot on https://dev.botframework.com and follow the steps to setup
      a Skype channel.
    * For the endpoint you setup on dev.botframework.com, copy the https link 
      ngrok setup and set "<ngrok link>/api/messages" as your bots endpoint.
    * Next you need to configure your bots MICROSOFT_APP_ID, and
      MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD environment variables. If you're running VSCode you 
      can add these variables to your the bots launch.json file. If you're not 
      using VSCode you'll need to setup these variables in a console window.
      - MICROSOFT_APP_ID: This is the App ID assigned when you created your bot.
      - MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD: This was also assigned when you created your bot.
    * To use the bot you'll need to click the join link in the portal which will
      add it as a contact to your skype account. 
    * To run the bot you can launch it from VSCode or run "node app.js" from a 
      console window.
